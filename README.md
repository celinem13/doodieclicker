# doodieclicker
This is the PointCrow cookie clicker inspired by a couple users from the PointCrow Discord Server. This was intended to be a gift to my favorite streamer PointCrow, but Unity and its multiple bugs, Gradle errors, and WebGL failures had other ideas. 

Currently, the game has 2 very simple features: clicking to make doodles and buy upgrades so your clicks are worth more.

The game is in a very early alpha and is expected to have a finished minimum viable project by late February (note: due to career and personal life, I may have to continuously push this deadline back as this is a personal project, and not related to my work). 

I do encourage people to take a look at what I've made and improve upon it. This isn't an idea I own. I do, however, wish to be created for the base of the project if you would like to copy the files from my GitHub. The license attached to the game is the MIT License; if you are not familiar with it, I recommend you take a look. I am excited to see what other game developers can do with the game. I plan to stream more of the development cycle on twitch.tv/celreeee to document my process.
